# Module_3-Challenge

## Description of the project

This project involves writing a smart contract to create an ERC20 token named BlackRock (symbol: BLRK). The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens to specified addresses, while any user can burn their tokens and transfer them to other addresses. The contract is written in Solidity and can be deployed using HardHat or Remix.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Ensure you have Solidity installed or access to an online compiler like Remix.
* If using HardHat install the necessary dependencies by running:

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the contract:

* Open Remix at [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
* Create a new file and paste the contract code.
* Compile the contract.
* Deploy the contract using the Remix interface.

### For common issues:
* Ensure your Solidity version matches the pragma statement in the contract (`^0.8.18`).
* Verify that your wallet address is properly configured when deploying or interacting with the contract.
